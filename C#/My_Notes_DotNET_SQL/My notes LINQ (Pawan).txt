LINQ(Lannguage Integrated Query) To SQL :

Already their is an language known as SQL with ADO.Net

SQL=>SQL server ( ADO.net )
1.Runtime sysntax syntax checking of Sql statement
	- The sysntax checking is done by database engine not by compiler
		due to we pass cmd in "" hence compiler dont verify it.
	- Hence ever time the query is fired it goes to database engine 
	which increases the overlload
 
2.not type safe 
3.No Intellisense suppot is available
4.debuging of sql stmts is not possible
5. Code is a combination of Object oriented and relational


Eg of Query:
"insert into student Values("+textbox1.Text+",'"+textbox2.Text+"')";
I.E : we have to again again with "" '' and textbox field are not
		understanded by compiler
     insert into student Values( 10 , 'Pawan')


LINQ => SQL Server
1. Compile time systax checking.
2. Reduced the Database engine.
3.Type safe as a develop u never need to know the column and table 
	type.. here intellisenc provide all knowledge
4.Debugging is supported.
5.pure object oriented code.

	table			=	class
	column			=	property
	rows 			=	Instance
	stored Proc 	= 	Methods
	
	-to work with linq tosql firt we need to convert all th realational object of 
	database into object oriented types and this process is known as 
	ORM (Object relational maping)
	
	To perfomrm this  we are provided with a tool OR designer
	
	OR (Object Relation ) Designer 
	this will help us to all into object datra type 
	Step 1: Perform ORM by  adding Or Designer
	Step 2: Adding a reference for an  assembly i.e system.data.linq 
	step 3:	we need tp write the connection string into the configure the  congfig
